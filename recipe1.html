        <h1 class="history">History of the Casserole</h1>
        <p class>The word <b>casserole</b> actually comes from a French word that means <i>'saucepan'</i>. The modern day casserole was invented in 1866 by Elmire Jolicoeur. Elmire was a French-Canadian <u>immigrant</u> living in a cottage in Berlin, New Hampshire. Though the casserole can date all they way back to 1250 where it derived from communal pots that people shared as meals. These early casseroles consisted of pasta sheets cooked in water and layered with grated cheese and spices. My dish came from my aunt when she created in for a thanksgiving dinner many years ago. Everybody loved it so now its a rule that if you want to be part of the family, you have to like the casserole.</p>
        <p>My Recipe  includes a very cheesy rice with bits of broccoli that tastes amazing. </p>
